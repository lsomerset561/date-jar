# DATE JAR

##Description
Web-based generator that displays a date idea picked at random out of the choices provided by the user.

This is my capstone project as part of completing the curriculum at Palm Beach Code School.  The goal is for the project to demonstrate competency of at least the following technologies: HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, and JavaScript and/or jQuery.

Some of my major goals for this project is for it to be created using a mobile first philosophy, responsive design via Bootstrap, and allow access for users who have JavaScript disabled.
